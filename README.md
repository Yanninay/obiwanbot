A simple no-surveillance bot for generating complex passwords

Have you ever wondered if sites collect the passwords they generate for you? If yes - this bot was created especially for you. It can generate a complex password of the right length, and has no connection to the Internet and does not send your data

But if you are paranoid and still do not trust us you can create your own bot using the source code above

Why does the bot have logging in a separate channel? This is done to keep track of raiders - people who like to send bots a huge number of messages to crash the bot. The information sent to the logs does not contain generated passwords
